  - Created visualizations from data set in order to analyze opportunities of profitability
  
## Questions to consider
  - Which studios hold the most weight in top grossing movies?
  - How have those studios held power within the past 5 years?
  - How favorable have those movies been, while still be top grossing?
  - How can runtime minutes play a factor in choosing which movies?
  - Which genre can hold strength in the movie business?
  - Which months, or seasons, are top grossing movies being released?

## Recommendation
 Microsoft should focus on Action/Adventure genres as well as optimal runtimes in order to maximize profit. Although subgenres of Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Comedy, or Drama are included in the top grossing movies of the last 5 years, it is the Action/Adventure that shows strength in profits both domestically and in foreign markets. Additionally, looking at specific studios and their share of top grossing movies can help steer the direction Microsoft should also go in.
