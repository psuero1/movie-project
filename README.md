## Process & Sources Used
  - Scraped IMDB, Box Office Mojo, and TMDB to gather data
  - Used the data provided to help see what direction to go 
  - Merged data sets in order to create one table to work off of
  - Created visualizations from data set in order to analyze opportunities of profitability
  
## Questions to consider
  - Which studios hold the most weight in top grossing movies?
  - How have those studios held power within the past 5 years?
  - How favorable have those movies been, while still be top grossing?
  - How can runtime minutes play a factor in choosing which movies?
  - Which genre can hold strength in the movie business?
  - Which months, or seasons, are top grossing movies being released?

## Recommendation
 Microsoft should focus on Action/Adventure genres as well as optimal runtimes in order to maximize profit. Although subgenres of Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Comedy, or Drama are included in the top grossing movies of the last 5 years, it is the Action/Adventure that shows strength in profits both domestically and in foreign markets. 
 
 Runtimes do not seem to be a factor for audiences since movies have been averaging around the same minutes. It would be good to stay around the average runtime in order to maintain consistency within the market.
 
 Additionally, looking at specific studios and their share of top grossing movies can help steer the direction Microsoft should also go in. BV has a hold on top grossing movies, but specifically those popular Action/Adventure genres. This shows that audiences favor Action/Adventure movies specific to BV studio. Taking a closer look at what BV does differently could be the key to high profitability.
