## Recommendation
 Microsoft should focus on Action/Adventure genres as well as optimal runtimes in order to maximize profit. Although subgenres of Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Comedy, or Drama are included in the top grossing movies of the last 5 years, it is the Action/Adventure that shows strength in profits both domestically and in foreign markets.
